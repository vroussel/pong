# pong
Pong game written in lua using love2d framework.

This is done following the [CS50 2D course from Harvard](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/zoom/#cs50s-introduction-to-2d-game-development), but with some personnal tweaks :)

## What personnal tweaks ?
 - pause menu
 - no class.lua library dependency
 - removed most global variables in main.lua
 - other slight code changes here and there (less magic numbers, code paths combined, etc)
 - ball speed display (with dynamic color)
